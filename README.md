Final project for first year general engineering course

Required to reverse engineer a existing product, we selected a voice activated elevator where I was the sole hardware designer and programmer

Using either bitvoicer for a voice activated response, or 3 pull down buttons to select a floor.
A stepper motor was used to drive the lift
